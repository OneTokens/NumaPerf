Overheads:
    1.Overheads from the invoking of real::malloc.(mallocation of pageInfo,cacheInfo,objectInfo,entryInHashMap)
        a. too much number of invo
    2.Overheads from too much memory access in the malloc function
    3.Overheads in the handle access is higher after the program running a while(imbalance in the hashmap)
    4.Start counting some information after second thread writing
    5.shadow mapping?
Function:
    1.how to output

The key to reduce overheads is to reduce cache miss(small footprint and small cache invalidation). And also reduce lock contention.

Overheads
1. overheads from MemoryPool:
    solution: add thread local cache , or try ptmalloc
2. I guess samling is necessary, but with a smart sampling which do not influence it effects
